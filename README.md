#Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer who loves debugging software engineering problems and moving tougher problems to a conclusive solution. 

I  worked in core enginnering teams of GEDigital,Jp Morgan help building software and solutions handling terrabytes of data, working at a scale in highly concurrent systems.
Leveraged distributed capabilities of Apache Spark with Scala apps to move/transform billions of records across various datastores eg: Apache Cassandra

I have a decade experience in designing, building and developing big data software solutions.
To the core of my work, I find ways to automate repeated/patterned problems, build small tools around them which helps reduce software developement cycle and do test driven development
